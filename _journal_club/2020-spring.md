## Week of January 31 - Alex Lalejini

Paper: [S. Kriegman, D. Blackiston, M. Levin, and J. Bongard, “A scalable pipeline for designing reconfigurable organisms,” Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, p. 201910837, Jan. 2020, doi: 10.1073/pnas.1910837117.](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/01/07/1910837117)

### Overview

- Authors demonstrate a scalable pipeline for creating functional lifeforms:
  1. use AI methods to automatically design candidate lifeforms in silico to perform a desired function
  2. feasible designs are then used as blueprints for a cell-based construction toolkit
- Authors deployed their pipeline to create systems that exhibited four different behaviors: locomotion, object manipulation, object transport, and collective behavior.

### Some Background

Existing methods for designing and building 'designer' living systems:
- single-cell that have been genetically engineered
- synthetic organoids can be made by exposing cells to specific culture conditions (there is limited control over structure and function)
- bioengineering with 3D scaffolds

### The Pipeline

1. Generator: evolutionary algorithm that discovers different ways of combining the biological building blocks together to realize a desired behavior
2. Build filter:
  - Only designs that are noise-resistant are used as candidates for transfer to cell-based construction
  - Is this design manufacturable?
  - Is this design scalable?
3. Build designs out of frog stem cells
  - Cells are harvested from frog embryos, dissociated, and pooled to achieve a desired number of cells
  - Cells are incubated
  - Cell aggregates are manually shaped by subtraction => microsurgery!
  - Contractile tissue can be embedded/layered into cell aggregate
    - Contractile tissue = cardiac progenitor cells
4. Result: 3D approximation of evolved design, can exist in aqueous environment for period of days to weeks
5. Feed real life results back into initial evolutionary algorithm, repeat.

### Questions

- This was an interesting future direction worth talking about: "If equipped with electrically active cells and selected for cognitive or computational functions (30), such designed systems may similarly broaden our under- standing of how intelligence can be instantiated in living as well as nonliving systems."
- Has anyone had any experience with the cube-y robot system they evolved designs in?
- Radical applications for 'xenobots' that were not mentioned in the paper?
- Has anyone looked at their: https://github.com/skriegman/reconfigurable_organisms ?
